Self-driving cars, also known as autonomous vehicles, rely heavily on neural networks to perceive and interpret their surroundings, make driving decisions, and navigate roads safely without human input. These vehicles are equipped with sensors like cameras, LiDAR, radar, and GPS, whose data is processed using deep learning models.
